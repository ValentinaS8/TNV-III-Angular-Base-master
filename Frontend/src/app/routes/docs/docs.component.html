  <h1>Official Documentation</h1>

  <p>In order to realize this web application, we used the following APIs:
    <br><a href="https://www.troposphere.io/developer">Troposphere.io</a> (API Meteo)
    <br><a href="https://about-corona.net/documentation">About-corona</a> (API Covid)
    <br>To generate charts, we used the library "ChartJs":
    <br><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJs</a> (Official documentation)
    <br>On our Trello's desk you can find all the notes and links we used:

  <h3>Project Presentation</h3>
  <p>Our web application presents two screens: “Dashboard” and “Graphics”.
    It also has a working login / register system.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Login/Register</li>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Charts</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Login/Register</h5>
  <p>The login/register system doesn't save any data on DB, so, the system will keep track of your registering data only
    up to the next web application reboot.
    In order to access the dashboard or the charts, you have to register yourself. When you'll try to reach one of them,
    the system will ask you for your credentials, and it'll let you access the dashboard or the charts only if your data
    are correct.</p>
  <h5>Dashboard</h5>
  <p>Our Dashboard allows you to be aware of European weather and covid real-time data, according to the last updates
    from APIs. </p>
  <div> By clicking the "All Europe" button, you'll have access to the data concerning all the following European
    countries:
    <div><br>
      <ul *ngFor="let country of europeTranslate">
        <li>{{country}}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>If you prefer to view information about a country (choosen from above list), you can select it in the dropdown
    list and click “submit”.</div>
  <br>
  <h5>Charts</h5>
  <div>Charts allow you to view the European data in a graph.
    The screen is splitted into two parts: in the first part you can see, in real-time, covid data and weather
    information concerning European countries, divided by types.
    Whereas, in the second part, you can find analysis based on the first part's data, as the ratio between deaths/cases
    and AQI (Air Quality Index), or the amount of deaths/cases in relation to the wind speed.</div>
