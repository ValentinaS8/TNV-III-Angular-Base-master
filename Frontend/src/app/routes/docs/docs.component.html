  <h3>Project Presentation</h3>
  <p>The project is basically split in two screens: Dashboard and Graphics. Also, there is a working login / register system.  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Login/Register</li>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Charts</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Login/Register</h5>
  <p>The login/register system will not save any data on DB. <br>But, the system will check if your credentials have been registered before the login, in the register. </p>
  <h5>Dashboard</h5>
  <p>Our Dashboard permits you to know European weather and covid real-time data, with the last update from APIs. </p>
  <div> By clicking the button "All Europe" will be available all the European data, from this countries:   
      <ul *ngFor="let country of europeTranslate">
        <li>{{country}}</li>
      </ul>
    
  
  </div>

  <div>Or, you can see details about one or different countries, by selecting the country in the dropdown and submitting.</div>
  <br>
  <h5>Charts</h5>
  <div>Charts will permit you to see graphically the European data. The screen presents two parts: all the European Data, divided by types, of weather and covid in real-time; in the second part, you can see analysis on that data, as the ratio between deaths/cases and AQI, or between Wind Speed. </div>
